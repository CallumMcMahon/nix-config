This is a NixOS configuration repository.

It configures:
- my personal MacOS nix-darwin ARM laptop
- a server deployments to Hetzner cloud

I use Cloudflare for my domain name, `callums-server.co.uk`
Tailscale to keep services within a private network.

All commands and utilities that I have are documented in the NixOS config.
Whenever recommending that I run a command that is non-standard (assuming it's not mentioned in this config), use
`nix-shell -p <pkg>`

## Mac setup
Run `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .` to rebuild my environment.
